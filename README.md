## Idea 1

#### **Brief:**

Gating system which only unlocks the LLM once the user has shown pre-commitment to thinking via:

1. Behavioural Evidence
      - Have they drafted enough original content?
      - Have they created an outline/plan?
      - Time-on-task + revision activity
2. Neurophysiological Evidence
      - EEG-derived proxies for engagement / cognitive effort during drafting
      - Personalised thresholds from a short calibration phase

## Idea 2

#### **Brief:**

A “brain-in-the-loop” visual search system that uses EEG signals during Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) to detect when a user recognizes a target image (e.g., via P300 / ERP target responses) and then re-ranks / flags likely targets for faster triage (security footage, medical screening queues, content moderation, satellite imagery).
