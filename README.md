## Idea #1

<div align="center">

### **AI Human Brain Alignment**

> EEG-informed gating for responsible LLM assistance in academic work

</div>

**Brief:**

Gating system which only unlocks the LLM once the user has shown pre-commitment to thinking via:

1. Behavioural Evidence
      - Did they write enough?
      - Did they outline enough?
2. Neurophysiological Evidence
      - Features consistent activity with Idea Generation and Engagement

**Aim:**

Encourage authentic ideation before the use of LLM by unlocking AI support only after measurable engagement signals

**Deliverables:**

A desktop/browser middleware that controls LLM access + a small study comparing gated vs ungated use on originality and retention

**Novelty:**

Real-time neuroadaptive "cognitive warm start" for AI assistance

**Research Questions:**

Main:

- Does EEG + Behavioural gating increase original contribution and learning/retention compared to ungated LLM access?

Mechanism:

- Can we reliably classify "Idea Generation / Engaged Drafting" vs "Passive Copying / Low Effort" from consumer EEG + keystroke signals in real-time?

UX:

- Does gating harm user experience, or does it feel like a helpful "coach"?
