> EEG-informed gating for responsible LLM assistance in academic work

#### **Brief:**

Gating system which only unlocks the LLM once the user has shown pre-commitment to thinking via:

1. Behavioural Evidence
      - Have they drafted enough original content?
      - Have they created an outline/plan?
      - Time-on-task + revision activity
2. Neurophysiological Evidence
      - EEG-derived proxies for engagement / cognitive effort during drafting
      - Personalised thresholds from a short calibration phase

#### **Aim:**

Encourage authentic ideation before the use of LLM by unlocking AI support only after measurable engagement signals

#### **Deliverables:**

A desktop/browser middleware that controls LLM access + a small study comparing gated vs ungated use on originality and retention

#### **Novelty:**

Real-time neuroadaptive "cognitive warm start" for AI assistance

#### **Research Questions:**

Main:

- Does EEG + Behavioural gating increase original contribution and learning/retention compared to ungated LLM access?

Mechanism:

- Can we reliably classify "Idea Generation / Engaged Drafting" vs "Passive Copying / Low Effort" from consumer EEG + keystroke signals in real-time?

UX:

- Does gating harm user experience, or does it feel like a helpful "coach"?

#### **Scope / Assumptions:**

- EEG is treated as a noisy but useful signal
- System supports behaviour-only gating as a fallback
- Gating targets academic pipeline workflows
